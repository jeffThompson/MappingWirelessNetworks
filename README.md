Mapping Wireless Networks
=======================

Code, data, and (possibly coming soon) schematics for recording wireless network data around a city. The enclosed code runs in Python, since it seems to interface cleanly with my Mac. A version is coming shortly for Android.

####HOW TO USE
Run the 'MappingWirelessNetworks.py' file (I run via TextWrangler in Terminal) on a laptop. Drive around! The current system does not record location data; a smartphone with a GPS-tracking app would work easily.

The raw output contains a lot of extra data; the 'RemoveDuplicateEntries.py' file sorts and removes any duplicates, returning just the network names.

####ENCLOSED DATA
The 'OutputData' folder contains currently-gathered data for various cities (Detroit, Chicago, etc). Feel free to gather data in your area! If you do, sending it by email would be appreciated.

####THANKS
Special thanks to Andreea Vasile and Dustin Altschul for helping map wireless networks in Detroit, Michigan, USA. Thanks to Steve Coy at Lawrence Technological University for organizing the project in Detroit.
